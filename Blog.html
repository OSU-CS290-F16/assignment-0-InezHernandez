    First Post: 9/24/2016 - Reflecting upon Assignment 0
  </h4>
  <h2>
    What challenges or troubles did I have completing this assignment?
  </h2>
  <h3>
    <p>
      Many. I think a few of us did. It was mostly challenging in that I have never done web development before. I transfered here from Portland Community College and had only taken C++ classes where the only thing we needed to do was download one thing, Windows Complier, and code. It was a simple and intuitive process that the instructor lead us through.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coding is fun for me though, I enjoy seeing my work come together and create something that is functional. Coding is not hard, what is hard and what was hard for this assingment was getting set up to start uploading things. I was not able to go to laptop set up due to job training and it just made this whole homework assignment that much more difficult since I could not access the network. In addition to that, I am not as afluent in the coding world, I only know what I learned in my CS160, CS161, and CS162 classes that only covered C++. I never had to use PuTTy or anything else like it. So reading through the forms was more perplexing than helpful.
    </p>
  </h3>
  <h2>
    How did I solve these problems? <em>Well...</em>
  </h2>
  <h3>
    <p>
      I know that my greatest weakness is my timidness, but it can be a good thing as well! I tried to do as much as I could on my own first, show that I put in a good effort before asking for help. I looked through the questions on Piazza and set up my phone to notify me of email recieved on my OSU account to keep me updated on the latest questions posted. I also took a deep breathe, ok more like a hundred deep breathes since I was so lost in what it was I needed to do to get my code online. Then I did what I was most comfortable doing first, coding. Using the services provided by CodeAcademy I wrote out all my code that I wanted to eventually publish. I needed to get that out of the way first. Then looking through the questions, I was still lost, so going to office hours was my next step.
    </p>

  <h2>
    What did I learn from this assignment?
  </h2>
  <h4>
 
      Well a few things I hope! Some include:
    	<ul>
				<li> Coding HTMl </li>
					<ol>
						<li> Learning how to code sub items. </li>
        		<li> Learning how to insirt images and be creative.</li>
					</ol>
        <li>Most importantly I learned how this class works.</li>
        	<ul>
            <li>I leanred the office hours of the tutors and instructor.								</li>
            <li>I learned hopfully how to use all the resources available to me. And most importantly what the expectations are for this class.
            </li>
        	</ul>
 			</ul>
  </h4>
  <h2>
    What things did I already know?
  </h2>
  <h4>
    <ul>
      <li>I already know that I love coding seeing my web up makes me even more sure of my choice to major in CS.
      </li>
      <li>I already knew that this class was going to be hard, but I also knew that it was going to be rewarding once I got the groove of things. And it's true! I really enjoy this class and hope to be doing some amazing things later in the year! Maybe even be able to start a side business in making webpages????
      </li>
      <li>I already knew how to do a bit of coding. I did do some coding on CodeAcademy and I liked it, but then life got to crazy and I forgot about it till now! I also took a weekend class on HTML through ChickTech high school, but that was more than two years ago.
      </li>
      <li>I also knew a few other things besides the basics since I volunteered at the Washington County Museum over the summer and helped them with their website using Publisher, which I guess doesn't count since it formats everything with a click of a button, but I did try and type out some of the code because it was fun.
      </li>
      <li>I also did C++ coding at PCC and so I know the basics and understand how code works and some resources for coding. So my web code also is formated in the way I would usually do it in C++, with indentations and an easy to read format. I also know that white spaces are reduced down.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </h4>
  <h2>
    What resouces were most helpful in completing assignment 0?
  </h2>
  <h4>
    <p>
      I think the most helpful thing was CodeAcademy. I was able to log into my account and just start typing out my code. I was helpful in that I could at least get that out of the way first. I was pretty stuck on how to upload things so I decided to get help in person. Since I was not able to attend laptop set up I did what I could on my own and went to the Engineering help desk and got help from them first.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that I went through all the turials and fiddled around on my own. I also looked through the Piazza form and downloaded PuTTy just in case I needed it. I looked up some YouTube videos on how to use PuTTy and realized I still could not access the network for my Engineering account and decided to talk to either the TA or instructor in person.
    </p>
  </h4>
  <h2>
    How did I use these resources?
  </h2>
  <h4>
    <p>
      Well CodeAcademy was a resource I used to just check my code for bugs and to just give myself a breater. The deadline was comming up soon and I did not want to start off the term with a zero already. So using CodeAcademy allowed me to at least check one thing off the list of many things I still needed to do. It was very stressful that the part I was stuggling with was not even my code, but instead the set up. So being able to get my mind off that really helped just clear my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going in person and getting help is how I learn best. Especially since I have never used any of the programs being mentioned on the Piazza form, all the talk about ssh and flip was very overwhelming. I felt like I was not up to the task of taking this class, but going in person is much better because I can see what they are talking about vs. me trying to decode the meaning. It was helpful reading through Piazza though!
    </p>
    <p>
      Reading through the form helped me realize that I was not the only one who was confused and stressed out. It allowed me to gain a bit of confidence that maybe I would survive week 0 as well! It also pointed me in the right direction. Even though I could not log into the network I at least had a fuzzy idea of what it was I was going to need to do when I went in person to get help.
    </p>
    	All the resources were good to use and I feel like the hardest part is behind us. The set up was terribly complicated, but now the rest of the term seems much brighter!
