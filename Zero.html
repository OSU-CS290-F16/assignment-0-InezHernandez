	<h2>
  Some formalities to get out of the way:
  </h2>
  <h4>
    <ul>
    	<li>
        My name: 
       	<ul>
         <li>
           Inez pronounced I-Nez formally and if we become chummy friends then I'll let you call me E-Nez like the girl from Cyberchase!
         </li>
        </ul>
    	</li>
      
      <li>
        My Major:
        <ul>
          <li>
            I am doing an applied CS major with a minor in business. I did a business focus program and got an award for it at my old high school, so I hope to continue in that! I want to hopefully work in a business/tech setting later on such as a startup or something similar. That's currently my dream job. A Very fuzzy picture, but I will continue doing this since it is the only reason I decided to go to college in the first place. If I had not been introduced to CS I really might have not done more than trade school. So I owe a lot to it, and hope to be able to continue onward in this field.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        On a scale from 0-10 how confident am I in web development?
        <ul>
          <li>
          I would say I am a 5. When it comes to coding, the acutal coding of a website. Not the whole process of uploading or the terminology. On how confidenct I am right now with this assignment I think I'd say about a 2.

    <h6>
      Hah, ended on lucky 7! That's a good sign right?
    </h6>
  </h4>
  <h2>
   	Have I signed up for Piazza? YES!
  </h2>
  <h4>
      It might not have been extremely helpful, but at least it gave me an idea of what I needed to do! It was also nice to see that my fellow classmates are nice enough to help out other students!
  </h4>
  <h2>
    Most interesting fact about me? Hmmm...
  </h2>
  <h4>
    There really is nothing to terribly intersting about me. Something that won't come off as weird or as a bad habbit? I guess the thing that surprises a lot of people is that I am super Mexican at heart? That I am an old soul as well, I like Elvis's <em>Return To Sender</em>. I also really like Bon Jovi! And Los Tigres Del Norte have a special place in my heart. The most interesting thing about me, I guess, is my music tastes.
